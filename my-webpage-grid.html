                                As
                                an
                                international hot spot, NYC is host to culinary experts from all across the globe. Some

                                the

                                or

                            <p>3. The Theatre
                                Some of the greatest actors and performers of the last 100 years made their name on a
                                Broadway
                                stage!

                                they hit the big time! But don’t feel tied down to Broadway. Seeing any theatre in the
                                city
                                is a

                                stepping into another world. Another way of life! A life where the Subway can decide
                                your
                                whole

                                you (whether you like it or not). Where parades are as regular as a monthly rain. A life
                                where
                                everything is within reach but you still have to work to grab it! It’s true what they
                                say,
                                if
                                you
                                can
                                make it here, you can make it anywhere.

                        <p>Long Street could be described as the funkiest and loudest street in Cape Town, bustling

                            Once the vintage clothing shops and designers alleys are closed, attention is turned to

                            attract
                            loyal customers. Newer restaurants such as Galbi, a Korean BBQ spot gather new followers

                        <h6>Castle of Good Hope </h6>

                        <p>The first stone was laid on 2 January 1666 and it was completed by April 1679
                            The materials used to build the Castle were local and included rock cut from the
                            granite
                            outcrop
                            on
                            Signal Hill, and blue slate and shells – transported from Robben Island
                            The Castle was built by soldiers, volunteers, slaves and Khoi undergoing punishment.
                            The
                            building
                            housed everything from a church, bakery and living quarters, to various workshops,
                            shops
                            and
                            prison
                            cells, among other facilities
                            The Castle was never attacked. Battles against the British were fought at Muizenberg
                            in
                            1795 and
                            Blaauwberg in 1806

                            The Castle of Good Hope was not built by Jan Van Riebeeck. A four-pointed clay and
                            timber fort
                            was
                            the first building to be erected in his time, and it was his suggestion that this be
                            replaced by
                            a
                            more permanent structure that could withstand the elements and possible attacks. The
                            existing
                            stone
                            “star fort” was built four years after Jan van Riebeeck left the Cape
                            The Castle of Good Hope was referred to as “Kui keip” (Stone Kraal) by the Khoi and
                            sometimes
                            “Citadel” by Dutch settlers
                            Yellow paint was originally chosen for the walls because it reduced the effects of
                            the
                            hot
                            African
                            sun
                            On a visit to the Castle today you can expect to pay R28 entry for adults, and R12
                            for
                            children
                            under the age of 16. You can even see a blacksmith in action – just as he would have
                            operated
                            during
                            the 17th and 18th centuries when castles housed their own forges.</p>
